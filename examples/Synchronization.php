	Rules:
		1. only ever wait FOR something
		2. only ever wait FOR something
		3. only ever wait FOR something

	Only one thread may enter synchronized() on a ThreadSafe object at any given time, unless the synchronized closure calls wait().
	Other threads which try to use synchronized() at the same time will block until either:
		a) the currently-executing synchronized callable calls wait() on the ThreadSafe object
		b) the currently-executing synchronized callable returns.
	
	Threads are not guaranteed to execute in any particular order; therefore, the following code could execute in one of two ways:
		a) the synchronized callable inside the Thread executes first, causing the main thread to never call wait(), and exit gracefully
		b) the synchronized callable on the main thread executes first, calls wait(), allowing the child thread to wake it up using notify(), and exit gracefully.
