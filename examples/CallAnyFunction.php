	This isn't built in as it's a pretty simple task to achieve for your self
	I can't really think of any functions that are labourious enough that you
	would want to execute them by themselves in a thread of their own. Maybe
	you have functions within your own code that could be called in parallel without
	refactoring for multi-threading capabilities ...

	I personally think you shouldn't try to make chocolate from cheese and you
	would be better of refactoring your code to be multi-threaded ...

	But here's an example of how you would achieve such a task:
