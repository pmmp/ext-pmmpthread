--TEST--
Test iterating on ThreadSafeArray objects produces the same ThreadSafeArray objects as property reads
--DESCRIPTION--
ThreadSafeArray iteration was bypassing local property cache, causing a new ThreadSafeArray object to be created every time a ThreadSafeArray member of a ThreadSafeArray object was yielded by foreach.
