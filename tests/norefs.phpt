--TEST--
Test members (typeof object) with no other references
--DESCRIPTION--
In pthreads v2, you were charged with responsability of the objects you create, however in pthreads v3, a ThreadSafe object
is able to retain a reference to another ThreadSafe object, this makes programming Thread objects a lot simpler, 
the code in this test would fail with pthreads v2 and will work as expected with pthreads v3, which is a win for everyone ...
